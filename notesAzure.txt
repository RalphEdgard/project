cloud is compute networking storage and other services managed by someone else 

cloud providers = compaanies who build data centers, fill servers netowrking and other equipment 

cloud services have ai, iot, kubernetes and much more 

5 chars of cloud characteristics 
- on demand self service : no human interaction is needed for resource provisioning 
- broad network access: resources in the cloud can be accessed from anywhere 
- resource pooling: physical resources are shared between customers 
- rapid elasticity : resources can be scaled up and down easily (online shopping problem)
- measured service : payment is done only for resources actually used (server time, function time) 

capex capital expense making up front investments for profit (servers from shopping ex)

opex operational expense you pa for what you use 

types of cloud services 
- iaas : infrastructure as a service cloud provides underlying playform (compute storage and network like vm)
- paas : platform as a service the cloud provides platform for running app (above plus webapps) 
- saas : software as a service software running on cloud (provider takdes care of updates patches and more, ex office 365) 

on prem you are responsible for everything 

iaas you control vm 

paas you are responsible for app and data 

saas you are not responsible for anything you just use the app 

faas, dbaas, daas, iotaas, aiaas probably more 

types of clouds 
- public : set up by public network 
- private : managed by it teams organizations premises set up 
- hybrid : set up in org prem but also connected in pub cloud (priv data on prem and pub data in pub cloud) 

regions - what each data center is called 
zones - fome of the regions have more than one physical data center, 
each data center is called zone 
when there are more than one zone in the region you have availability zones

paired regions : some regions have designated pair region needed when a full region fails another can take its place 

subscription : logical container containes various resources you provision in the cloud 

account : identity with access resources in the subscription 

SLA service level agreement - defines uptime % of cloud service (yearly downtime) 


to calculate actual sla need to mutliply all service actual sla and then you get result which gives actual downtime 

cost 
- pricing model
	- per resource 
	- per consumption
	- reservation 






website that shows you all of azure products 

you created 
- resource group 

when you select a region its important to know geo proximity to systems audience 

storage account used to store explicit data storage quite cheap 




architects and the cloud (for architects)
- need to know non func req, tech stack, components architecture, communication patterns 
- cloud based systems req an addition security and infrastructure knowledge 
- hands on

you need to keep into consideration the information that you come across and you need to ensure how you can work with it in azure
